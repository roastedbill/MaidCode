# MaidCode 魅码
Web IDE that cares about your feeling rather than just features.

We are serious about this project. I know a lot of us feel lonely and 
lack of care from time to time. Don't be shy and keep it to yourself.
We need to find a way out before it turns worse.


Please let us know if you need any help or have any further idea on this project.
